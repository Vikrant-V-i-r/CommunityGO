# 🦸 Community Hero

### A Pokemon Go-style civic issue reporting app for Indian cities

> **Problem Statement 2 — Community Hero: Hyperlocal Problem Solver**
> Spot potholes, water leaks, broken streetlights, garbage pileups & more. Snap a photo. Let AI categorize it. Watch your city fix it in real-time. Earn Civic Coins, climb the leaderboard, unlock badges.

Built for the **Google AI Hackathon 2026** (deadline: 30 June 2026, 11:59 PM).

---

## 🎯 The Problem

Indian cities lose thousands of crores every year to civic issues that go unreported or get lost in fragmented complaint pipelines. A pothole that takes 5 minutes to report through official channels often takes weeks to fix — and citizens have no visibility into whether anyone is even looking at it.

The status quo is broken in 3 places:

1. **Friction** — Existing complaint portals require login, form-filling, manual category selection, and tracking numbers citizens immediately lose.
2. **No visibility** — Citizens don't know if anyone else has already reported the same pothole, whether a team is on the way, or when it's fixed.
3. **No incentive** — Reporting feels like shouting into the void. There's no reward, no social proof, no community momentum.

## 💡 The Solution

Community Hero turns civic reporting into a **Pokemon Go-style neighborhood quest**. Every civic issue becomes a "Pokestop" on a live map — color-coded by status (🔴 Active / 🟡 Fixing / 🟢 Solved). Anyone can report, verify, or update an issue, and the entire community sees the change in real time.

### What makes it different

| Traditional complaint apps | Community Hero |
|---|---|
| Form-heavy, login-walled | One-tap guest login. Snap → AI fills the form → confirm. |
| Manual category selection | **Gemini Vision** auto-categorizes (pothole / leak / streetlight / etc.) |
| No community layer | Anyone can verify ("I also saw this"), update status, or share |
| Opaque status | Live timeline: FRESH → WIP → SOLVED with photos & comments |
| No incentive | **Civic Coins** for every action. Leaderboard. Badges. Levels. |
| Hard to share with authorities | One-tap PDF report card + WhatsApp/email deep links to BBMP, BWSSB, BESCOM, Traffic Police |

## 🎮 Core Workflow (E2E working in MVP)

```
Open app
  ↓
One-tap guest signup (pick a handle + avatar, get +50 🪙 welcome bonus)
  ↓
Live map opens (auto-detects GPS, falls back to Bengaluru demo)
  ↓
Color-coded Pokestops visible:
  🔴 Red pulsing = Fresh / Active issue
  🟡 Yellow pulsing = Work in progress
  🟢 Green ✓ = Solved
  ↓
Tap FAB → "Add Issue"
  ↓
Camera opens → snap photo of real-world issue
  ↓
[AI AGENT PIPELINE]
  ├─ Gemini Vision classifies the photo (category + severity)
  ├─ Gemini Vision writes a punchy title + 2-3 sentence description
  ├─ Gemini Vision routes to the correct authority dept (BBMP/Police/Water/Electricity)
  └─ Returns structured JSON with confidence score
  ↓
Pre-filled form (user can edit anything before posting)
  ↓
"POST & EARN +50 🪙" → Issue goes live on the map
  ↓
Anyone passing by can:
  ├️ Tap the Pokestop → view the bento card with photo, description, location, timeline
  ├️ "Verify" — community confirmation (+10 🪙)
  ├️ "Update Status" — append a photo + comment to the timeline
  │     ├️ WIP = +10 🪙
  │     └️ SOLVED = +100 🪙 + 500 XP
  └️ "Share" → generate a PDF report card → one-tap WhatsApp/Email to authority
  ↓
All stakeholders get live alerts when status changes
  ↓
Solved issues remain on the map as 🟢 green checkmarks — a permanent civic victory
```

## 🧠 Agentic Depth (20% of evaluation score)

We built a **multi-step agentic pipeline** on top of Gemini Vision:

1. **Vision Classification Agent** — Analyzes the photo and returns strict JSON: `{category, severity, authorityDept, title, description, confidence, safetyTips, estimatedImpact}`. Prompts are engineered to be hyper-local to Indian civic infrastructure (BBMP, BWSSB, BESCOM, Bengaluru Traffic Police).

2. **Auto-routing Agent** — Decides which authority department the issue should be routed to based on the category and the photo content (e.g. a fallen tree touching power lines → BBMP forest cell + BESCOM, not just BBMP).

3. **Safety Agent** — Every report generates a one-line safety tip for citizens encountering the issue (e.g. "Avoid the right lane; the pothole is hidden by standing water").

4. **Freshness Check Agent** (planned, in code) — `checkIssueFreshness()` runs on each issue view to decide if a stale issue is likely still active and prompts passersby to verify.

5. **Reward Agent** — Coins & XP distribution logic runs server-side after every action, with badge unlock heuristics.

The agents are wired together in `src/lib/ai-agent.ts` and called from `src/app/api/issues/create/route.ts`. If the AI fails, the system gracefully falls back to "OTHER / MEDIUM / BBMP" so the user is never blocked.

## 🔮 Google Technologies Used (15% of evaluation score)

| Tech | Where we use it |
|---|---|
| **Gemini API (Vision)** |  → `chat.completions.createVision()` — analyzes the issue photo, returns structured JSON |
| **Gemini API (Chat)** |  → `chat.completions.create()` — freshness check agent, future expansion to multi-turn triage |
| **Google Maps** | Deep links `https://www.google.com/maps?q=lat,lng` for directions to any issue |
| **Google Cloud Deploy (target)** | App is structured for one-click deploy to Cloud Run via `gcloud run deploy` (see deployment notes below) |

## 🎨 Innovation & Creativity (20% of evaluation score)

- **Pokemon Go metaphor** — First civic app to frame reporting as a "spotting" game. The pulsing red pokestops feel alive. Green ✓ markers feel like collected badges.
- **Bento-styled issue cards** — Each issue detail is a tight bento grid: hero photo, status pill, severity/verifications/confidence trio, location+directions duo, authority dept, timeline, verifiers list.
- **Neo-arcade design system** — Bold saturated status colors (red/amber/emerald), chunky rounded cards, glassmorphic bottom sheets, big central FAB with radial menu, playful micro-animations (pulse on FRESH, badge unlock toasts, coin reward popups).
- **Agentic photo → form fill** — The user never types unless they want to override the AI. This is the key UX innovation: 30-second reporting.
- **PDF report card with QR** — One-tap shareable to authority contacts via WhatsApp/Email/Tel deep links. The PDF includes a QR code linking back to the live issue page.
- **Community verification layer** — "Verify" button = Wikipedia-style consensus. Anyone can confirm "I also saw this." Each verify awards coins.

## 🚀 Local Development

```bash
# Install deps
bun install

# Push DB schema
bun run db:push

# Seed dummy data
bun run scripts/seed.ts

# Start dev server
bun run dev
# → http://localhost:3000
```

### Default credentials
- **No login required** — pick any handle on first launch (e.g. "PotholeHunter")
- Guest session is persisted in localStorage

### Seeded demo data
- **6 dummy users** with varying coin/XP/badge counts (CivicRaptor, PotholeHunter, BengaluruBrave, JungleRani, StreetWatch, FixItFox)
- **10 realistic Bengaluru issues** spread across Indiranagar, Koramangala, HSR, Whitefield, MG Road, Silk Board, EGL Park
- **6 authority contacts** (BBMP, Traffic Police, BWSSB, BESCOM, Fire, Police) with dummy phone+email
- Mixed statuses: 5 FRESH, 3 WIP, 2 SOLVED (with full timelines)

---

## ☁️ Deployment to Google Cloud (Cloud Run)

### Option A: Cloud Run (recommended)

```bash
# 1. Build the standalone Next.js bundle
bun run build

# 2. Containerize (use the Dockerfile below)
gcloud builds submit --tag gcr.io/PROJECT_ID/community-hero

# 3. Deploy to Cloud Run
gcloud run deploy community-hero \
  --image gcr.io/PROJECT_ID/community-hero \
  --region asia-south1 \
  --allow-unauthenticated \
  --set-env-vars "GEMINI_API_KEY=your_key,DATABASE_URL=file:/data/app.db"
```

### Option B: Google AI Studio (one-click)

The app is compatible with AI Studio's deploy flow:
1. Push this repo to GitHub
2. In AI Studio → New Project → Import from GitHub
3. Set environment variables (Gemini API key)
4. Click Deploy

### Persistent SQLite on Cloud Run
For production, swap the SQLite file for Cloud SQL (Postgres) by changing the `DATABASE_URL` and updating `prisma/schema.prisma` provider to `postgresql`. The rest of the codebase stays unchanged.
